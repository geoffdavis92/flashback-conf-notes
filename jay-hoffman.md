  - Role that combined web architect and author
  - "Postmaster" for email spec
  - Webmaster was same function for websites
  - Webmaster = web creator
  - Comes from tradition of academia, research
- Versatile
  - "Wears many hats"
  - Design, code, deploy
- Collaborative
  - Comparable to general contractors
  - Knows who to talk to if they don't know how to do something
- Skillful
  - Always learning
- Ownership
  - Web creator owns entire site
  - Implements features, fixes bugs
  - Antiquated role, but important to know the history
- Evolution of web 
  - Added design
  - Never intended to be in the web by TBL
  - Brought in designers, outside stakeholders/specialists
  - "Sites became the business itself"
  - Amazon.com selling things
- Things got too hard (Reason #1)
  - …for just one person
  - Increasingly complex duties, beyond what was technical
  - Not just exchange of services/information
  - Word Magazine, Silicon Alley (NYC)
  - Blue Dot: collection of web experiments
  - Razorfish
- Digital Agencies
  - Sell a multitude of digital experiences
  - Razorfish was among the first digital agencies
  - Did the heavy-lifting of managing sites during part of Dot Com Bubble
  - Still plenty for a web creator to do
- Things got too easy (Reason #2)
  - …not "everyone can do it", but less friction
  - Re-thinking using digital agencies
  - "Everyone needed a website"
  - …but what can you do if you're not Yahoo (i.e. a Mom-and-Pop shop)?
- First Frictionless/WYSIWYG Tools
  - Dreamweaver
  - Drupal
  - AWS (2002) started as set of APIs
  - eBay also utilized APIs (via widgets)
- Flash
  - First used by msn.com
  - Bundled with IE, then Netscape
  - Early 00s, graphic designers came onto the web; knew how to use Flash
  - Eroded web standards
- Roles of the web creator were dwindling
  - All frictionless tools were built _for_ the web creator
  - But created a false narrative
  - Web creator stuck in the middle between high-level solutions like digital agencies and low-level solutions like APIs, WYSIWYG
- Webmasters never disappeared
  - "The twist"
  - We created a whole new web
  - Role is still there; it built the web
  - Chris Coyier's "The All Powerful Frontend Developer" talk (versatility)
  - Devs adopted the roles, qualities of the webmaster
  - Glitch (collaborative)
  - Open-source communities/open collective (collaborative)
  - Dev.to (skillful)
  - IndieWeb (ownership)
- If we let the qualities of the webmaster shine through, we can build something to be proud of
