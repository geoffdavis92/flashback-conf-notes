- Changes seen in Web Dev recently, over career
  - LW: Preprocessors, advanced frontend stack
  - AG: Open source movement
  - SC: Deploying code advancements
- Is web dev more difficult than [5 years ago]?
  - SC: Harder, _and_ easier
    - Had to know more concepts (provision a server)
    - Now can just push to GitHub
    - But, now more steps to optimize/build code
    - Barrier to entry is lower, especially due to specialization
    - Also can increase likelihood of imposter syndrome
  - LW: More fullstack devs/webmasters, now in a second wave of innovation
    - React, Vue, Angular, etc
    - More new tools/libraries/etc being developed
    - Great, but exhausting
    - Barrier to entry is lower with new tech (CodePen, glitch.me) but a lot of noise to filter
  - AG: Easier to get started, but more complex problems today
    - Machine learning
    - Barrier to entry is lower, more resources
- How are trends in FinTech different than the rest of tech?
  - LW: Worked for FinTech consultancy; scares the crap out of me
    - Lots of antiquated layers
    - Expensive, difficult to tie new stuff (React, etc) into legacy systems
  - SC: Work with FinTech companies
    - Work to protect data as much as possible
    - Some data becoming available
    - Bar of bureaucracy at banks will probably lower over time
  - AG: (respond to GitHub financial programs) We should pay [OSS maintainers]
    - Crazy to me that companies don't support OSS authors
    - GitHub Sponsors has a bright future ahead of it
    - Working for sponsorship levels for corporations
- Low-code/No-code solutions: thoughts on how to use these tools?
  - LW: I've used some of this professionally; I hate them
    - Spent all this time learning to become a [custom] application developer
    - Have more control over how I build apps/sites
    - Wix/Squarespace/Webflow can empower non-technical users who want to make their own websites
  - AG: Agree with LW; sites are important for scaling as a business
    - If tech is your product, websites should be built in-house
    - WYSIWYG tools are great for non-tech consumers
  - SC: Probably agree if talking WYSIWYG
    - Devs love feeling important
    - Used MagnoliaCMS (like AEM)
    - Updating site use to take a full development cycle
    - Now, devs make new components for this CMS
    - Eventually, a lot is going to be low/no code
- What is something you're most excited about new/upcoming tech?
  - AG: Consumer-driven solutions (cloud computing)
  - LW: IE dying
  - SC: AWS ?? streams
- Q&A
  - As someone more experienced, how to make it easier for new-comers?
    - LW: Pair programming, maintaing docs, onboarding process planned out
    - Janell: Diversity matters, helps juniors feel secure
    - SC: Don't be a jerk
