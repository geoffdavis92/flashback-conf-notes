- Call into question long-standing assumptions from the early 
- Death of ideas
  - Great for a time, but lead to more evolved ideas
- The Beginning of the Web
  - Started as links from one place to another
  - How people could access information (people-first)
  - Went from "easy to access" info to "easy to overload users' attention"
  - Decisions that affect how we use the web (authors' view vs. users' view)
- Change how we build
- Early Web
  - Inlining of HTML, CSS, JS in early days
  - "Separation of concerns"
    - "User cares most about content" (HTML)
    - Cake metaphor
    - The layers were "optional" (aside from HTML)
    - 2 strategies emerged from SoC
  - Graceful degradation
    - Good features, but if optional features were not available, still get a fxnal website
    - Escalator metaphor (Mitch Hedberg) - Aaron Gustafson
    - Should this have been where our efforts aligned?
  - Progressive Enhancement
    - Flipped Graceful Degradation
    - Decide base functionality, then add features as possible

      - List of hacks to test ways to sniff browsers
    - "Focus was on the technology (initially)"
- Web performance optimization
  - Was once a "cottage hobby", now a full industry
  - Early "yslow" rules
- FOUC
  - Flash Of Unstyled Content
  - Users hated this
  - "Problems created by attempting to solve problems"
  - FOIT/FOUT (same concept, but for fonts) font-display.glitch.me
  - FUBC (flash of unbehaviored content)
    - Functionality (JS) not initialized yet
- Chase site
  - Do users like spinners?
  - "JS libraries allow us to add more spinners performantly"
  - Users are just tolerating what we're building
- The Great Lie
  - Technology-layered delivery is "morally" superior
  - "Where do our technology priorities stand?"
  - Step back to ask what a user will think in a moment of [downscaled video quality]
- Responsive Design
  - Father of responsive design: Ethan Marcotte (@beep)
  - Another excuse that puts developer priorities above user priorities
  - "Has anyone ever resized their browser and remarked at the reflow?"
  - Need to be honest a lot of these principles were mostly for us
- Divide in the Web Community
  - css-tricks.com/the-great-divide
  - Great divide between content/styling folks and functionality folks
  - Some missing context as to why JS people feel the pain of this divide
  - "JavaScript is the problem of the web"
  - Tom Dale "Progressive Enhancement is dead"
  - "We made these divides because we divided based on technology"
- Mapping applications example
  - Google Maps vs. Mapquest
  - "You can still have a compelling mapping application without JavaScript"
- Alex Russell (@slightlylate) quote
  - "You need to demonstrate tech choices do no harm"
  - Need to evolve ideas back to the user
- Priority of Constitutencies
  - "In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over specifiers over theoretical purity…"
- Adaptation is part of the problem
  - "Accidental survival"
  - What we're automating is compensation for our limitations
- User Agent
  - Browsers are user agents – middleman
  - Browsers revisioned as user Advocate
- Configuration 
  - Often thought of as a "dirty word"
  - "Users can't understand all the available details"
- Product + UI + UX = Imprintable Design
  - Design where the user imprints themselves into/onto the experience
  - #ImprintableDesign
- Progressive Enhacnement
  - Focused on devs and tech
  - Design focused primarily on each person
  - Several blockers
- blockers for PE
  - Flawed: designing for consistency
    - "Has anyone not [completed website task] because the scrollbar wasn't purple?"
    - Taking browser UI differences and paving over to be consistent
    - Creating a11y problems
    - Zeldman quote: Not identical, pixel perfect; content is perceivable
  - Flawed: if the device can do it, the user wants it
    - "WebGL rendering 3D bus route on 2G connection with 2% battery" example– need to determine how users can tell us what way they want to see content/use site
    - webkit.org/blog/8970/how-web-content-can-affect-power-usage
    - African village power/phone charging
  - Common thread: _we_ think we know better
  - Flawed: browser knows best
    - How much CPU/memorty available? Yes
    - Power unlimited/free? No
    - Unlimited data? No
    - Hands usable? No
    - Lighting conditions? No
    - Some things, but vast majority only people know best
  - Flawed: people always want the most powerful experience
    - Special apps built to deliver through Opera Mini (low-fi Facebook example)
- Who's using your site?
  - How do you _really_ know who your users are? 
  - Analytics? Deeply flawed
- Statistics marginalize people
  - Tailoring experiences to the majority
  - These people matter
- New numeronym
  - e12y
  - Empowerability
  - Building a web that empowers people
  - (on top of a11y)
- How do we talk about site visitors?
  - User? visitor just a utility
  - Customer? visitor just there to provide $
  - Person: matters far more than just what visitor clicks on in a website
  - Put people first
- Can we just ASK the person (what they want)?
  - Pick your font size
    - Recommendation by w3C
  - "Load basic HTML" link from Gmail
- Need a new term from Progressive Enhancement
  - Progressive Experience?
  - Personalized Experience?
  - People Empathy
- How to practice People Empathy through Imprintable Design?
  - People must be given control over their web experiences
  - Precedent for asking user what they want
    - Safari Reader mode
    - Headers availble from server, to media queries
    - Client hints
  - User needs to be active participant in site
- "Currencies" users understand
  - Speed
  - Battery level
  - Cost (of bandwidth)
  - What users have to spend to have experience on the web
  - Summarize 3 currencies into 1 setting?
  - Person and browser work together to decide
- Fidelity slider
  - Just a sketch
  - Slider to decide how to affect currencies
  - Not technical, people decision
  - "request-fidelity" header
  - Send resources based on fidelity preference, servce optimized experience
  - Send or skip features/components, alter behavior of app
  - Batch requests
  - Treat like offline app
- Browser (user advocate) must veot server over resource responses
- First steps?
  - Should we wait on browsers to adopt? No
  - Build features into apps
  - Browsers object because they
- "No one has disproved the benefits of PE or proposed a better technique"
  - sitepoint article
- PE is dead, long live people empathy and #imprintabledesign
