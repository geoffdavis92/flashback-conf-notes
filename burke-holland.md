- What does Serverless mean?
  - Abstract details of implementation
  - Law of least consumption (only build what you'll use)
  - Inherent scale built-in (scaling can never be _your_ problem)
- Serverless fundamentals
  - Storage (static hosting provider)
  - FaaS (Azure functions, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud functions)
    - Mostly marketing
    - Executes code in the cloud
- The Good
  - Cost
    - Won't charge if no one uses an app
    - Charge per execution (ex 20¢ per million function executions, 6¢ per gb stored, 8.7¢ per gb in/out)
  - Speed
    - Solved by cloud providers
  - Scale
    - Testing with artillery CLI
    - Servers being added/removed as requests come in
  - Local development experience
    - Local Azure function debuggable locally
  - CORS easy to configure
- The Bad
  - Auth
    - Easy for social login (in Azure)
    - Proprietary logins difficult (in Azure)
  - Hosting
    - ???
  - Metrics
    - No access to servers
    - Demo'd Azure monitor (paid monitoring service)
- Ugly
  - Proxy
    - Difficult to do in Serverless
    - Solution demo'd with Front Door
    - Able to route requests
  - DNS
  - Cold start
    - First (few) requests spins up services
    - Stays in memory; spins down after N seconds
