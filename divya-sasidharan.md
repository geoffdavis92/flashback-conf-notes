- Slicing Bread
  - Pre-slice bread
  - Convenient
  - JAMStack emerged from similar idea
  - "Why can't we pre-slice [static stack]
- JAMStack
  - JavaSCript, APIs, and Markup
  - easy to build
  - easy to deploy
- Static sites/assets
  - Static, but dynamic
  - (Different kind of static)
  - Early static sites
    - Deploy files to server
    - Architecture changed for building sites/web apps
  - Increasing complexity nowadays
  - JAMStack abstracts a lot of the complexity
  - Stack moves away from servers 
- What is/is not JAMStack
  - Pre-rendered site/SPA ✅
  - Isomorphic SSR SPA ❌
  - Traditional CMS site ❌
  - Monolithic fullstack app ❌
- Why is this a compelling model?
- Immutable deploys
  - Build -> generate -> deploy cycle
  - FTP'ing into server affected state of server, made debugging difficult
  - Versioning content is difficult
  - Atomic deploys
- Build automation
  - Modern SSGs
  - Build commands, good dev experience
  - No manual configs
  - Non-technical individuals can trigger builds
  - Headless CMS
    - Contentful
    - Wordpress
    - Ghost
- Event triggers
  - Webhooks
  - If `<This>` Then `<That>`
  - Different options
    - Auth events
    - Commits
- Serverless
  - Most apps today are monolithic (site generated per site visit)
  - Monolithic infrastructure scaling needs
  - JAMStack scales needed
  - Dynamic functionality largley requires backend functionaity
    - May lose benefits of JAMStack
  - Frontend de-coupled from the backend
  - Splitting up services into microservices
    - auth0, okta
  - Functions as a Service
    - Invoke APIs, services as needed
    - Demo of Netlify Forms
    - Demo of Netlify Functions
    - Demo of Netlify Identify
    - Demo of Netlify Events
- Road to the JAMStack
  - Get assets to CDN
  - Design for immuatble deploys
  - Automate all the things
  - Serverless all the things
